## 1. "Quantum computing for the determined" by Michael Nielson

   - YouTube video series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2q1PuI2RFI&list=PL1826E60FD05B44E4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2q1PuI2RFI&list=PL1826E60FD05B44E4)
   - Really basic and intro level in Quantum, however some linear algebra knowledge are preferred to understand some math related theories. 
   - For newly studying or reviewing linear algebra, here is the link to Khan Academy, they did really good jobs on that: [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra )     

## 2. Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit (IBM Qiskit textbook)

   - [https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html)
   - It provides basic concepts which are necessary for understanding quantum computation. 
   - It also lists some linear algebra concepts here: [https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-appendix/linear_algebra.html](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-appendix/linear_algebra.html ) in case you need some review or just scan through to have some ideas in linear algebra
   - In addition, IBM Quantum Experience provides a fantastic platform to allow learners like us to have hands-on experience on running quantum circuits, writing quantum programs and so on. Here is the link: [https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login ) I have to say that is so damn cool for me. 
   - By the way, I think it will be awesome if you can contribute to their open source projects in quantum. Since it is the one of the biggest quantum community I found so far, and IBM also offers some research interns or summer school programs for those who are interested in consuming careers in this field. And so you are most likely to find someone who have the same interests as you and build up your network.
