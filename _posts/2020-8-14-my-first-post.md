Hi there, welcome to my first post !

### What you can find in my blog ?
1. Some study notes in areas I learnt or am learning 
	- Currently interested in Quantum Information, and CTF
2. I am trying to work on my personal projects, so you probably will find some links to my rough projects and also notes on how I build a project and problems I came across. 


### Why am I doing this?
1. To keep a record of all things I learnt which helps me to revise and see how I can improve a little bit 
2. To share with people who may be on the same spot as me, who wants to learn something new but not sure where to start with since there are too many resources online.
3. To get feedbacks from you if possible in case of mistakes I made or just simply say hello to me

**Hope you can find something interest you or help you in one way or the other. 
Enjoy reading :)**
